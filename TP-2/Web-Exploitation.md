## Inspect HTML:
 This was easy i just need to inspect the website HTML code and the flag was already present there.
 ```bash
picoCTF{1n5p3t0r_0f_h7ml_8113f7e2}
```

## IntroToBurp:
  I was asked to visit the website where there was a registration form to fill after filling i was asked to enter otp and after i entered i found i was not given flag so i decided to use
  ```burp suite``` for intercepting the otp so i opened the webiste in the burp browser and enetered the website there and after that i transferred it to proxy and and put the intercept on
  i clicked on submit otp i got a request 
  ```

I decided to remove the otp from below and clicked on forward i successfully got the flag after that.
```bash
Welcome, a you sucessfully bypassed the OTP request. Your Flag: picoCTF{#0TP_Bypvss_SuCc3$S_b3fa4f1a}
```

##  Dont-use-client-side:
In this i inspected the code and found the if and else loop where flag was already there.
```bash
if (checkpass.substring(0, split) == 'pico') {
      if (checkpass.substring(split*6, split*7) == 'a3c8') {
        if (checkpass.substring(split, split*2) == 'CTF{') {
         if (checkpass.substring(split*4, split*5) == 'ts_p') {
          if (checkpass.substring(split*3, split*4) == 'lien') {
            if (checkpass.substring(split*5, split*6) == 'lz_1') {
              if (checkpass.substring(split*2, split*3) == 'no_c') {
                if (checkpass.substring(split*7, split*8) == '9}') {
                  alert("Password Verified")
                  }
                }
              }
      
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    else {
      alert("Incorrect password");
    }
```

##  Sql direct:
This challenge was good i used ubuntu terminal to connect but before connecting i was asked to download so with the command i download postgres:
```bash
 sudo apt install postgresql-client
```
After i connected ```psql -h saturn.picoctf.net -p 61325 -U postgres pico``` with password ```postgres```. After that ```\?``` game me help commands where i saw ```\d```
which list all the tables where i found a table named flag.
```bash
         List of relations
 Schema | Name  | Type  |  Owner
--------+-------+-------+----------
 public | flags | table | postgres
(1 row)
```
Now with simple SQL query ```Select * from flags;``` which game me the flag
```bash
pico=# Select * from flags;
 id | firstname | lastname  |                address
----+-----------+-----------+----------------------------------------
  1 | Luke      | Skywalker | picoCTF{L3arN_S0m3_5qL_t0d4Y_73b0678f}
  2 | Leia      | Organa    | Alderaan
  3 | Han       | Solo      | Corellia
(3 rows)
```

## Some Assembly:

## Who are you:

This challenge was fun when i visited the website i came with gif saying you need to use Pico-browser to use it so i used Burp-Suite to check the request and decided to edit
So i changed the name of browser in my sending request to Pico-Browser.
```It asked hw dont trust people coming from different website``` So i checked for header that can provide the website and i found ```Referer``` header ``` contains the 
absolute or partial address from which a resource has been requested.```.
After this it asked me to change date to ```2018``` so with the ```Date``` header i changed it to ```2018```.
After that it told me he only allows users   ```who cannot be tracked``` so ised ```DNT``` header and put it as ```1```.
After that it told me to change my IP to Sweden so i found a header ```X-Forwarded-For``` which will act as a proxy to change my IP address and put some Sweden IP address.
After that it asked me why i dont speak ```sweden``` so in ```Accept-languages``` i added ```sv```
This is how i got the flag.
