SQL injection (SQLi) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. 
A successful SQL injection attack can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as:
    Passwords.
    Credit card details.
    Personal user information
Some common SQL injection examples include:
    1.Retrieving hidden data, where you can modify a SQL query to return additional results.
    2.Subverting application logic, where you can change a query to interfere with the application's logic.
    3.UNION attacks, where you can retrieve data from different database tables.
    4.Blind SQL injection, where the results of a query you control are not returned in the application's responses.
